## ðŸŒ„ About This Repository

This repository holds the supplementary materials for my talk at KubeCon.

- Demo Steps and Details
- References

### About Demo

The demo during the talk was fully based on the input in this repository. You should be able to replicate the same setup following the steps detailed in this repository.

### About Demo Script

During the presentation, I cheated ðŸ«£ a little by using a script to mock the typing effect. This is backed by a simple shell script https://github.com/rytswd/cli-demo-helper.

### Why X? Why Not Y?

I designed my talk specifically on "moving parts" around multi-cluster observability. The solutions such as `istioctl` provide friendly UX for Istio management, but from my own experience, it is crucial to understand those "moving parts" in order to handle even more complex scenarios.

The demo was meant to be something anyone can replicate in their own environment. Once you follow the demo details, you should be able to see where the actual "moving parts" are, and how to tackle them for your use cases.


## ðŸŒ… Contents

### Prerequisites

In order to run through the demo steps, you will need the following tools:

- Docker
- kubectl
- kind
- kustomize
- helm

Because the demo is about multi-cluster observability, there will be multiple clusters required. Please note that having 3 KinD clusters will require some significant compute resource on your machine.

### Simplest, All In One

``` sh
bash <(curl -sSL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rytswd/kubecon-eu-2023/main/demo-all.sh')
```

The above script will give you the typing effect I used in my demo, and will set up the same exact setup.

### Detailed Steps

Please check out [Demo Steps](demo-steps.md) for details.

### Clean Up

If you followed the demo steps above, you can clean up by simply removing the clusters.

```sh
{
    kind delete cluster --name cluster-1
    kind delete cluster --name cluster-2
    kind delete cluster --name cluster-3
}
```

### Troubleshooting

If you found any misbehaviour with the setup, please feel free to create an issue. While I'm not intending to maintain with the latest details here, I still check activities and may be able to help.
